            <h2>What's Super Stats?</h2>
            <p>
                Super Stats is a statistics mod for Planetary Annihilation Titans and Classic.
                It provides in-depth statistics and information about each game, as well as the winner.
                Units, economy, APM and server mods are all tracked in every game.
            </p>
            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>
                PA Stats was decomissioned many months ago and it looks like Community Stats won't be coming out for a while.
                 Additionally, only a 'lite' version is currently possible according to mikeyh.
            </p>
            <h2>Comparison with PA Stats</h2>
            <p>
                Super Stats has nearly all of the functionality of PA Stats. Structure and engagement locations are omitted, and games with Dynamic Alliances will not report to Super Stats.
                Super Stats improves upon PA Stats with some key features such as tracking the game result on the profile of every player in the game, rather than those who just report.
                It also tracks server mods and has special indicators as well as a unit database for a small selection of those mods.
                Furthermore, Super Stats has some support for tournament games and links to casts of games.
